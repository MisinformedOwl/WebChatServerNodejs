# Web Chat Server

A very basic web chat server i made when i was learning node.js and docker. Node js is pretty cool, and i got a bit of hands on experience with express a useful tool to manage url's and pushing page content. Aswell as websockets, i have experience with web sockets from using them in both C and python. However this is a nice tool as it allows me to make multi user applications. Should i wish to do so.
